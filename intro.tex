This answer key follows on from the excellent answer key produced by
Dr Pardue's math 490 class at UMBC, available at
\url{https://github.com/madkous/math490}.  That answer key covered
chapters 1--3 of Emily Riehl's book, while this one covers chapters
4--6.

This was produced by a group of volunteers, mostly attendees at the
HoTTest Summer School 2022.  Their names can be found on the first
page and in the source files of these solutions.

These solutions are solely the responsibility of the respective
