This answer key follows on from the excellent answer key produced by
Dr Pardue's math 490 class at UMBC, available at
\url{https://github.com/madkous/math490}.  That answer key covered
chapters 1--3 of Emily Riehl's book, while this one covers chapters
4--6.

This was primarily written by Julian Gilbey as he worked through the
textbook; one solution was written by @yonsla (4.1.i).  The first few
solutions were checked by @zin3724 (and one by @quomat).

These solutions may contain errors, and there are probably nicer ways
to answer many of them.  Please do flag any issues or make any helpful
comments via GitHub at \url{https://github.com/juliangilbey/cat456}.
