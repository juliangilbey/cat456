Guidelines for contributing
============

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

Please read Matthew Kousoulas's style guide
[here](https://github.com/juliangilbey/math490/blob/minor-latex-fixes/style-guide/style-guide.pdf)
for guidance on how to write solutions.

I have provided template files for each exercise in chapters 4-6.
They have a slightly different naming scheme.

If you would like to contribute, you can either request write-access
to the repository or make a PR for your solutions.  Please stick to
one exercise per PR.  We also have a list of who is working on which
exercise, so please contact me before starting to type to avoid a
duplication of effort.
