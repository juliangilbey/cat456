Guidelines for contributing
============

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

Please read Matthew Kousoulas's style-guide.tex
[here](https://github.com/madkous/math490/blob/master/style-guide/style-guide.tex)
for guidance on how to write solutions.  If you would like to compile
the style guide for ease of readability, please clone my
[patched version](https://github.com/juliangilbey/math490) of the
repository and use the minor-latex-fixes branch instead (provided as a
PR to the original repository); there are some problems with the
original version.

I have provided template files for each exercise in chapters 4-6.
They have a slightly different naming scheme.

If you would like to contribute, you can either request write-access
to the repository or make a PR for your solutions.  Please stick to
one exercise per PR.  We also have a list of who is working on which
exercise, so please contact me before starting to type to avoid a
duplication of effort.
